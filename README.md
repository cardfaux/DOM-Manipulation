*getElementsByTagName get the elements by their HTML tag names, P, LI, IMG, INPUT, ect...*
*getElementsByClassName gets the elements by their assigned className(s)*
*These give you back an HTML Collection*

*In the console you can run console.dir(element-variable) To get the object representation of it.*

## querySelector()

**A all in one method to select a single element**

## guerySelectorAll()

**textContent is all the words in the element including script tags console logs but just the text of them**
